# Project_BinarySearchTree
Author: Jiawei Hao
Project partner: Casper Guo

This project implemented a reduced version of binary search tree and map classes. Within binary search classes, nodes are sorted and linked together for efficient searching. 
The driver program uses custom class and built in map function to achieve a machine learning like program that classifies piazza posts. 
This project emphasizes on practicing linked list and object oriented programming.
